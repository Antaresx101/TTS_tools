"""How the updater block is embedded in a tool file. Standard library only.

Both scripts here work on the same thing - a tool.lua is the script with
updater/updater.lua pasted onto the end and four config values filled in - so
that one operation lives here rather than in two slightly different copies.

A tool may also have an XML UI, authored as tool.xml beside it. That file is
not published: stamp() splices it into tool.lua as a Lua long string, and the
block applies it at load. One file is the whole tool, which is why an update
cannot land half of one - there are no halves to land.
