"""Repo consistency check. Standard library only; run before push.

    python scripts/validate.py          check everything, change nothing
    python scripts/validate.py --fix    put right what can be put right, then check

Every tool folder is checked against the rules the updater block relies on at
runtime. The one that bites hardest is version drift: if manifest.json says
1.2.0 while tool.lua still says TOOL_VERSION = "1.1.0", every client downloads
the payload on every single load, forever, and throws it away at the last gate.
Nothing in game reports that. This does.

--fix is the drop-in path: put a folder under tools/ holding the object script
as tool.lua and a manifest.json beside it, run it, and the folder is a
publishable tool. It pastes updater/updater.lua onto the end of the script,
fills the config in from the folder name and the manifest, and re-pastes the
block over any copy that has drifted. It never touches the code above the
block, and it never decides a version: the manifest says what is
published, and tool.lua is made to agree with it.

A tool that also has an XML UI authors it as tool.xml in the same folder. That
file is not published - --fix splices it into tool.lua as a Lua long string,
and the block applies it at load - so what is checked here is that the spliced
copy is still the file beside it. Nothing fetches tool.xml, so a tool is one
file and an update cannot land half of one.
