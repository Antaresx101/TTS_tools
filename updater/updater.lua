--[[ =========================================================================
  SELF-UPDATE BLOCK for keeping tools hosted via Github up to date.
  Source: https://github.com/Antaresx101/TTS_tools   (MIT)

  When using any of my tools with this functionality, in TabletopSimulator,
  typing "!update" in the chat as the host will automatically update all such
  tools in the session with the newest version (if it isn´t on it already).

  A tool is one file. Where it has an on-screen UI, that layout travels
  inside the script and goes on when the object loads, so an update is one
  download and one write, and cannot leave half a tool behind.

  Nothing happens until you ask. Loading a mod sends no requests and changes no
  scripts, it is triggered manually always.
